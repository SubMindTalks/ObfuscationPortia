use hugginface transformers to perform code obfuscation.
- substitute verbs for synonyms
- change camelcase, snakecase, pascalcase, kebabcase
- obfuscate coding style
- remove empty lines and comments and docstrings and type hints
- Rename all variables to mathematical symbols only

Once completed run the code again to ensure that it is still running and working and producing the same result as before

Do this for all python files in Baseline and save a mirrored filestructured result to Baseline_obfuscated. For obfuscated files that no longer do the same or can run/compile either retry and fix the errors, or give up and delete the file from Baseline_obfuscated
